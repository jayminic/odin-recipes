      <p>
        This Baked Crunchy Hot Honey Chicken delivers the perfect balance of crispy, spicy, and sweet—all without deep frying. Juicy chicken is coated
        in a golden, crunchy crust and baked to perfection, then drizzled with a rich hot honey glaze that adds a fiery kick with a touch of
        sweetness. The combination of spices and textures makes this dish irresistibly moreish, ideal for weeknight dinners or a crowd-pleasing treat.
        Serve it with your favourite sides for a flavour-packed meal that’s both indulgent and easy to make.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>For the chicken:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>6 cups cornflakes (use gluten free, if needed)</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot sauce</li>
        <li>2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins</li>
        <li>extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For the hot honey:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>½ cup honey</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons hot sauce</li>
        <li>1-3 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon chipotle chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
        <li>fresh thyme, cilantro, or parsley, for serving</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425° F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>
          In a food processor, combine the cornflakes, parmesan, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt. Pulse until you have fine
          crumbs. Alternatively, you can crush the crumbs in a ziplock bag by stepping on them. Dump the crumbs into a shallow bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl, add the hot sauce and chicken, and toss well to coat.</li>
        <li>
          Dredge the chicken through the crumbs, covering fully. Place on the prepared baking sheet. For a thicker coating, dip the chicken back
          through the eggs, then through the crumbs a 2nd time. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 20-25 minutes,
          until crisp all around.
        </li>
        <li>
          Just before the chicken is done cooking, make the sauce. In a sauce pot, warm together the honey, hot sauce, cayenne, chili powder, onion
          powder, and garlic powder, plus a pinch of salt.
        </li>
        <li>Drizzle the warm sauce over the chicken. Top with herbs. If the sauce thickens, warm for 5 seconds in the microwave.</li>
      </ol>
