      <p>
        The Mudslide cocktail is a rich and indulgent blend of vodka, coffee liqueur, and Irish cream, creating a smooth, dessert-like drink with a
        velvety texture. Served over ice or blended into a creamy frozen treat, this classic cocktail delivers the perfect balance of coffee,
        chocolate, and cream flavours. Topped with whipped cream or a drizzle of chocolate syrup, the Mudslide is a decadent choice for those who
        enjoy a sweet yet boozy treat, perfect for after-dinner sipping or a luxurious cocktail hour.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Chocolate syrup for glass decoration</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 oz. vodka</li>
        <li>2 oz. Bailey's</li>
        <li>2 oz. Kahlúa</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
        <li>Chocolate shavings for garnish</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Drizzle sides and bottom of 2 cocktail glasses with chocolate syrup.</li>
        <li>
          In a cocktail shaker, combine cream, vodka, Baileys, and Kahlúa. Fill shaker with ice, cover, and vigorously shake until outside of shaker
          is very frosty, about 20 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>Strain into prepared glasses. Garnish with chocolate shavings.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Flavored vodkas such as espresso and chocolate vodka also work well in this mudslide recipe.</li>
        <li>Don’t have a cocktail shaker? You can use a mason jar or any jar with a tight-fitting lid then strain through a mesh strainer.</li>
        <li>Avoid adding crushed ice to the shaker as the ice will melt quicker and water down the cocktail.</li>
        <li>For a colder cocktail, place the vodka in the freezer. It won’t freeze due to the alcohol content but instead, keep the drink cold.</li>
        <li>To quickly shave chocolate to garnish your mudslide, use a box grater.</li>
      </ul>
